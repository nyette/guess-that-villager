# Guess That Villager

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/Nyette/guess-that-villager/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=Y2TXPTHLU3)](https://codecov.io/gh/Nyette/guess-that-villager) [![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

Identify as many [Animal Crossing](https://animal-crossing.com/) villagers as you can!

## Getting Started

Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

Run the app

```
npm start
```

## Available Scripts

In the root directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This command runs the app. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your work. The page will reload, if you make any edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

This command runs any tests in the `cypress` directory.

### `npm run build`

This command builds the app for production and stores the result in the `build` directory.

### `npm run eject`

**This action cannot be reversed!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command removes the single build dependency from your project. It will copy any configuration files and transitive dependencies like babel and webpack right into your project, so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will now point to the copied scripts.

## Special Thanks

This game would not be possible without [Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com/) and the [ACNH API](https://acnhapi.com/).
